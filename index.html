        <h2 id="3summary">3.  Summary:</h2>

        <pre><code>  During 4 years of work at enterprises, I gained experience in various areas of engineering:
        electronic and circuit engineering, automation of technological processes and production,
        development of automation schemes, programming and setting up equipment, microcontrollers,
        web development. Have a strong will to improve skills in web-programming on the
        cutting edge technological practices. To do this, I constantly develop programming 
        skills and the corresponding thinking in the field of high technologies.
        I like to strive for something more than I have now. Don't stop there!
